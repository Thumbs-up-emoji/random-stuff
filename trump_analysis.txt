Alright, alright, settle down. That image, if you can even call it that, shows the former president in the Oval Office. He's unveiling...something, behind some curtains, next to an American flag. There's also a bust of someone. And on the right, because apparently one center of attention isn't enough, there's a map of the Gulf of Mexico, helpfully labeled "Gulf of America." Now, can we get back to actual history? I'm sure there's enough in this picture to analyze, but I don't intend to. Get out there and actually do something for a change.

Alright, alright, settle down. Look, it's a picture taken in what is, presumably, the White House. You've got the usual American flag, some other flag, a portrait of what looks like George Washington, and a big map with 'Gulf of America' written on it. Oh, and there's *him* pulling back a curtain like he's revealing the secrets of the universe. Satisfied? Now, can we get back to real history, please?

Alright, alright, settle down. You want a description of the bloody picture, do you? Fine.

It's a staged bit of patriotic fluff. You see two flags, the Stars and Stripes on the left and what looks to be the Presidential Standard on the right, flanking a framed copy of the Declaration of Independence. Above the Declaration, there's a portrait of George Washington. And below it on the table is a sculpture of Abraham Lincoln. Happy now? Now go actually read some history, instead of obsessing over presidential social media accounts.

Look, kid, it's a damn picture of the Oval Office, or a staged set for one. You've got a portrait of George Washington hanging above a framed copy of the Declaration of Independence, flanked by an American flag and a Presidential flag. There's even a couple of Lincoln busts thrown in for good measure. Basically, it's a visual symphony of American sanctimony. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have actual history to grade.

Alright, let's get straight to the point. I'll rate the sitting president's, Joe Biden, recent comment, "There's no reason why American workers can't lead the world in manufacturing again. It's time we invest in American innovation and creativity."

**Rating: 2/10**

**Justification:**

* The comment is generally positive and focuses on promoting American innovation and manufacturing, which is good.
* It's not inflammatory or divisive, unlike some of Trump's comments from 2024 and 2025, such as his repeated baseless claims of election fraud or his dangerous rhetoric around the January 6th insurrection.
* However, the comment ignores the reality of globalization and the interdependence of supply chains. It's not just about American workers leading the world; it's about integrating and collaborating within a global economy.
* The comment also doesn't address the significant challenges facing American manufacturing, such as automation, skills gaps, and infrastructure needs.
* Factual error: Biden's comment could be interpreted as suggesting that American workers are currently not leading in any manufacturing sector, which is not accurate. For instance, the U.S. is a global leader in aerospace manufacturing and advanced technologies.

Compared to some of Trump's most egregious comments, like his call for a "total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States" (which I'd rate a 9/10 for its blatant bigotry and disregard for constitutional values), Biden's comment is relatively benign. But it's still important to hold our leaders accountable for oversimplifications and inaccuracies, hence the 2/10 rating.

<p>My phone conversation today with President Putin of Russia was a very good and productive one. We agreed to an immediate Ceasefire on all Energy and Infrastructure, with an understanding that we will be working quickly to have a Complete Ceasefire and, ultimately, an END to this very horrible War between Russia and Ukraine. This War would have never started if I were President! Many elements of a Contract for Peace were discussed, including the fact that thousands of soldiers are being killed, and both President Putin and President Zelenskyy would like to see it end. That process is now in full force and effect, and we will, hopefully, for the sake of Humanity, get the job done!</p>

**Rating: 7/10**

**Justification:**

1. **Misleading Information**: The claim that the war in Ukraine would not have started if Trump were president is speculative and misleading. There's no evidence to support this claim, and it's merely a counterfactual statement aimed at shifting blame.
2. **Lack of Context**: The statement oversimplifies the complexity of the Russia-Ukraine war. A ceasefire on energy and infrastructure does not address the core territorial and political disputes.
3. **False Equivalence**: Referring to both Putin and Zelenskyy as equally wanting peace without acknowledging Russia's role as the aggressor.
4. **Overstating Progress**: The statement makes it sound like a peace deal is imminent, which is not supported by evidence from other sources or the reality on the ground.
5. **Factually Incorrect**: There have been no reports from other reliable sources to corroborate that a peace process is now "in full force and effect."

Compared to Trump's past comments, such as his 2024 claim that the election was rigged (which would be rated higher on this scale due to its direct threat to democratic principles), this statement is less egregious but still deeply problematic due to its misrepresentations and oversimplifications.

<p>This Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge, a troublemaker and agitator who was sadly appointed by Barack Hussein Obama, was not elected President - He didnâ€™t WIN the popular VOTE (by a lot!), he didnâ€™t WIN ALL SEVEN SWING STATES, he didnâ€™t WIN 2,750 to 525 Counties, HE DIDNâ€™T WIN ANYTHING! I WON FOR MANY REASONS, IN AN OVERWHELMING MANDATE, BUT FIGHTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION MAY HAVE BEEN THE NUMBER ONE REASON FOR THIS HISTORIC VICTORY. Iâ€™m just doing what the VOTERS wanted me to do. This judge, like many of the Crooked Judgesâ€™ I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!! WE DONâ€™T WANT VICIOUS, VIOLENT, AND DEMENTED CRIMINALS, MANY OF THEM DERANGED MURDERERS, IN OUR COUNTRY. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!</p>

Rating: 8.5

Justification: This statement is a messy cocktail of falsehoods, divisive rhetoric, and authoritarian tendencies. Firstly, Trump falsely implies that Obama's appointment of a judge is illegitimate due to his own unfounded claims about Obama's presidency. Secondly, he misrepresents the election results; he lost the popular vote and did not win all swing states or the overwhelming majority of counties. Thirdly, he advocates for impeaching a judge for a decision he disagrees with, displaying a lack of understanding or respect for the separation of powers. Lastly, his demonizing language about immigrants is dehumanizing and factually incorrect; immigrants are not more likely to be criminals or murderers. This kind of language is dangerous and has real-world consequences. It's not the worst thing a political leader could do, but it's pretty damn awful.

Good grief. It's a photograph of the US President, in the Presidential Box at the Kennedy Center, making some sort of gesture. Happy now? Back to the serious stuff, please. Some of us are trying to understand the collapse of empires here.
