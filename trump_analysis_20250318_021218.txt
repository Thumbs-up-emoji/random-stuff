Alright, look. It's a screencap of a CNN broadcast. The graphic shows results from what they're calling an "instant poll" taken *after* a speech President Trump gave to Congress. According to that poll, 66% of speech viewers thought Trump's policies would move the US in the "right direction" while 34% thought it was the "wrong direction." It's a quick and dirty assessment of the public's reaction to his speech, likely cherry-picked to make him look good. Don't read too much into it. Now, do you have any *actual* questions about history, or are we just wasting time on political fluff?

<p>I just spoke with the Acting Administrator of NASA, Janet Petro. She is coordinating our Team of highly respected Scientists, Space Engineers, and various other “geniuses,” who has agreed to let our Astronauts come home long prior to the two week period originally approved by NASA. Janet was great. She said, “Let’s bring them home NOW, Sir!” — And I thanked her. This began when I asked Elon Musk to go up and get the abandoned Astronauts, because the Biden Administration was incapable of doing so. They shamefully forgot about the Astronauts, because they considered it to be a very embarrassing event for them – Another thing I inherited from that failed group of incompetents. Elon and I have taken on the project, sending up the SpaceX Dragon, which has successfully docked and, hopefully, while there is always danger involved in such a mission, they will soon be on their way home — Taking off tomorrow, and landing on Wednesday. Exact times will be provided to you. Safety always comes first, and maximum standards are being adhered to. But after eight long months for a mission that was supposed to be eight days, IT IS TIME. I look forward to seeing Butch and Suni, and thank you again to NASA and Janet Petro!</p>

**Rating:** 8/10.

**Justification:**

This statement is a blend of misinformation, self-aggrandizement, and political attacks that are not rooted in factual evidence. Here are the key issues:

1. **Factual Errors:**
   - There is no record of astronauts being "abandoned" in space for eight months.
   - The Biden Administration did not "forget" about any astronauts.
   - There is no evidence that Elon Musk was personally involved in a rescue mission as described.

2. **Misrepresentation of NASA:**
   - NASA has a robust system for managing astronaut missions and would not need a presidential intervention for standard operations.
   - The claim that Janet Petro agreed to bring astronauts home earlier due to a presidential request is unlikely and unverified.

3. **Political Attacks:**
   - The derogatory language used against the Biden Administration is unprofessional and unbecoming of a presidential statement.

4. **Self-Aggrandizement:**
   - The emphasis on personal involvement and praise for Elon Musk without substantive evidence is problematic.

Given the context of other comments made by Donald Trump, this statement fits a pattern of misinformation and political grandstanding, which is highly concerning for a sitting president.

<p>Let nobody be fooled! The hundreds of attacks being made by Houthi, the sinister mobsters and thugs based in Yemen, who are hated by the Yemeni people, all emanate from, and are created by, IRAN. Any further attack or retaliation by the “Houthis” will be met with great force, and there is no guarantee that that force will stop there. Iran has played “the innocent victim” of rogue terrorists from which they’ve lost control, but they haven’t lost control. They’re dictating every move, giving them the weapons, supplying them with money and highly sophisticated Military equipment, and even, so-called, “Intelligence.” Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of IRAN, and IRAN will be held responsible, and suffer the consequences, and those consequences will be dire!</p><p>DONALD J. TRUMP,<br/>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</p>

**Rating: 7/10**

**Justification:**

1. **Factual Errors:** Trump oversimplifies the Houthis' relationship with Iran. While Iran does provide support to the Houthis, it's not accurate to say they "dictate every move." The Houthis have their own agenda and grievances, which are often domestic and not merely an Iranian proxy.

2. **Escalatory Rhetoric:** Trump's threat of dire consequences and potential retaliation against Iran for Houthis' actions is reckless. It escalates tensions and could provoke further conflict in an already volatile region.

3. **Lack of Nuance:** The situation in Yemen is complex, with multiple actors and dynamics at play. Trump's statement reduces this complexity to a simple "Iran bad, Houthis bad" narrative, which is not productive for diplomacy or conflict resolution.

4. **Context:** Given Trump's history of inflammatory remarks and escalatory policies in the Middle East (e.g., the Soleimani assassination), this statement is par for the course but nonetheless concerning.

While this statement is problematic, it's not the absolute worst a political leader could do (hence not a 10), but it's still quite bad.

Oh, for the love of... It's a bloody headline, from the New York Post, claiming Trump is tying for his highest approval rating and that Americans feel the country is on the right track. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have actual history to attend to. Whether any of that's true is another matter. Don't believe everything you read, especially on social media.

Based on the provided quote by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, I would rate this comment a 5.5 out of 10. This rating is influenced by the context of Trump's presidency and previous comments, as well as the content of Zeldin's statement.

Justification:

1. **Exaggeration and divisiveness (6/10)**: The phrase "strangulated the U.S. economy" is an exaggeration and oversimplification of the complex effects of environmental regulations. This kind of rhetoric is divisive and misleading, which is characteristic of Trump-era communications.
2. **False dichotomy (5/10)**: The statement presents a false choice between protecting the environment and lowering the cost of living. This is a common tactic used to oversimplify complex policy issues.
3. **Lack of evidence (5/10)**: Zeldin provides no evidence or data to support his claims about the economic impact of Obama-Biden era environmental regulations or how the Trump era EPA will achieve both environmental protection and cost of living reduction.

However, the comment does not contain outright falsehoods or direct insults, which is why it's not rated higher (worse). It's important to encourage open debate and critique of policies, but it should be done thoughtfully and with evidence.

**Rating: 7/10**

**Justification:**

1. **Context**: Trump's comment suggests that President Biden is not actively leading, likening him to an "autopen" (a machine used for signing). This isn't the first time Trump has questioned the competency of his political opponents.

2. **Factual Errors**: There's no evidence to support that Biden is not actively performing his duties as president. Biden has been actively signing executive orders, addressing Congress, and participating in international diplomacy.

3. **Implications**: This kind of rhetoric can be divisive and undermines the office of the presidency, but it's not unprecedented in political discourse. However, it's important to note that baseless accusations can contribute to misinformation and polarization.

4. **Comparison**: Compared to other comments by Trump, such as his unfounded claims of widespread election fraud in 2020 (which would rate higher, around an 8 or 9), this comment is less egregious but still problematic.

**Final Note**: As a professor, I encourage students to critically evaluate political rhetoric, check facts, and consider the implications of inflammatory language.

Alright, let's rate President Biden's comment: "It's something President Biden could have done. He said he couldn't, but President Trump did it!”

**Rating: 5/10**

**Justification:**

1. **Factual Errors:** Biden's comment oversimplifies the complexities of immigration policy. Trump's "Remain-in-Mexico" policy, formally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), was not just a matter of presidential will; it involved complex legal and diplomatic maneuvers, including negotiations with Mexico.

2. **Political Context:** Biden's administration has faced significant legal and political challenges in reversing Trump's immigration policies. The claim that Biden could have easily implemented similar policies ignores the legal battles and humanitarian considerations that have shaped his administration's approach.

3. **Comparative Analysis:** Trump's policies were highly controversial and faced numerous legal challenges. Biden's approach, while different, is not merely a matter of capability but also a reflection of differing priorities and values.

In summary, Biden's comment is misleading in its simplicity and ignores the nuanced reality of immigration policy. However, it's not egregious enough to warrant a higher rating given the complexities involved.

Alright, let's tackle this. I watched the clip, and it's Trump's comment on the Constitution's 14th Amendment and his belief that he can overturn it with an executive order.

**Rating:** 9/10. It's not a 10 because, while incredibly dangerous and misinformed, it doesn't directly advocate for mass genocide or war. But it's close, because it shows a blatant disregard for the foundation of U.S. democracy and the principles of checks and balances.

**Justification:**

1. **Factual Error:** Trump claims he can overturn the 14th Amendment with an executive order. This is utterly false. The 14th Amendment is part of the Constitution, and the only way to change or abolish it is through the constitutional amendment process, which involves Congress and the states—not merely an executive order.

2. **context:** This comment is consistent with Trump's previous remarks in 2024 and 2025, where he has repeatedly shown a willingness to challenge constitutional norms and democratic principles. For instance, his attempts to discredit the 2020 election results and his support for the January 6th insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.

3. **Implications:** Such a comment undermines the rule of law and the very foundation of the U.S. political system. It's not just about the inaccuracy; it's about the intent to mislead and the disregard for constitutional boundaries.

In summary, this comment is a dangerous and misinformed attack on the U.S. Constitution, warranting a rating of 9/10.

Based on the comment "Stranded NASA astronauts thank Musk and Trump," I'd give it a **4/10**.

Justification:
1. **Factual Errors**: There were no stranded NASA astronauts in space. If there were, I'd likely know about it. I suspect the president is referring to the return of astronauts from SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft. It's true that Elon Musk's SpaceX has been instrumental in bringing human spaceflight back to the United States, but there were no instances of astronauts being "stranded" in space.
2. **Self-Promotion**: Trump's inclusion of himself in this comment is typical of his self-promoting style, which is not becoming of a president.
3. **Misleading**: The comment could mislead people into thinking there was a crisis in space that required the astronauts to be "rescued," thereby elevating the significance of Trump's and Musk's involvement. This is consistent with Trump's usual attempts to make himself appear to be a savior.

Compared to other Trump comments, like his repeated false claims of widespread election fraud in 2020 (which I'd rate closer to a 7 or 8), or his 2025 claim that climate change is a Chinese hoax (a solid 9), this comment is less egregious, but still problematic.

<p>The “Pardons” that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen. In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them! The necessary Pardoning Documents were not explained to, or approved by, Biden. He knew nothing about them, and the people that did may have committed a crime. Therefore, those on the Unselect Committee, who destroyed and deleted ALL evidence obtained during their two year Witch Hunt of me, and many other innocent people, should fully understand that they are subject to investigation at the highest level. The fact is, they were probably responsible for the Documents that were signed on their behalf without the knowledge or consent of the Worst President in the History of our Country, Crooked Joe Biden!</p>

Rating: 8/10. This statement is a messy blend of baseless accusations, legal misinterpretations, and political rhetoric that is meant to inflame rather than inform. Here are the key issues:

1. **Legal Misinterpretation**: The president cannot unilaterally void pardons issued by a previous president. The claim that Biden's pardons are void because he used an autopen is absurd and has no basis in law.

2. **Factual Errors**: There's no evidence that Biden didn't know about the pardons or that the documents weren't explained to him. The idea that Biden's staff might have committed a crime by using an autopen is ludicrous.

3. **Baseless Accusations**: The claim that the committee "destroyed and deleted ALL evidence" is unfounded and conspiratorial.

4. **Political Rhetoric**: The use of derogatory terms like "Sleepy Joe," "Crooked Joe," and "Worst President in the History of our Country" adds nothing substantive to the discussion.

This statement is irresponsible and continues a pattern of misinformation and inflammatory rhetoric seen in Trump's statements from 2024 and 2025. It's not as bad as direct incitements to violence or human rights abuses (which would be a 10), but it's still highly problematic.

Rating: 1/10. This comment is benign, simply expressing enjoyment of a golf game with a noted professional. There are no political implications, no factual errors, and no harmful rhetoric. It's merely a personal remark, not a political statement. Compared to some of Trump's more controversial statements, such as his repeated claims of election fraud in 2024 and 2025, which I would rate much higher on this scale, this comment is practically innocuous.

Rating: 1/10

Justification: This comment is essentially benign. It's a personal acknowledgement and expressing gratitude which is a normal, polite, and human thing to do. It has no negative impact on policy, no factual errors, it doesn't appeal to divisive ideologies, nor does it cause any diplomatic issues. In the context of other comments made by Donald Trump, this one is remarkably unproblematic and innocuous, there is literally nothing wrong with it. Compared to other comments, such as accusing Joe Biden of hiding his medical aids, which was a serious accusation with no factual basis, or referring to the "Chinese virus", which was a thinly veiled attempt at racial division, this comment deserves a low rating, and thus it is a 1/10.

<p>We are actively monitoring the severe tornadoes and storms that have impacted many States across the South and Midwest — 36 innocent lives have been lost, and many more devastated. The National Guard have been deployed to Arkansas, and my Administration is ready to assist State and Local Officials, as they help their communities to try and recover from the damage. Please join Melania and me in praying for everyone impacted by these terrible storms!</p>

Rating: 2/10

Justification:
This statement is a appropriate response to a natural disaster, expressing concern, offering support, and calling for unity and sympathy. There are no factual errors, and it's a standard presidential response, thus the low rating. However, the professor in me must point out that the use of the phrase "try and recover" instead of "try to recover" is a common grammatical error, but that is a minor issue.

Compared to some of Trump's more controversial statements in the past, such as his comments on the 2020 election or the January 6th insurrection, and considering hypothetical comments he could make in 2024 and 2025, this statement is relatively unproblematic, hence the low rating. However, it's important to judge each statement on its own merits and within its specific context.
